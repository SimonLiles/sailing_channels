We are a couple of hard working entrepreneurs who found a way to cruise without retiring and our schedule is packed. Lennie is a General Contractor who builds custom houses and I am a Flooring contractor serving the largest homebuilders in Florida. We have been together 23 years and boating has been the passion for both of us. We had power boats for years until our youngest left for college and we had the time to sail. We bought a Hunter 49 in the BVI and sailed the Caribbean once a month for 3 years. Then we had the crazy idea that we would sail to Panama and up to San Francisco where I learned to sail in San Francisco bay. We decided we needed a Catamaran for that trip and that is when Lennie bought me a Gopro and we started the channel by accident. I posted a video to show my family and 300 people watched it. And that is how this all began. So if you love life, people and fun join our adventures and always tell us how you like the show!",2008-09-24,2343476,109,23300,FALSE,FALSE

A few years ago we sold a bunch of stuff and bought an old (but sturdy) Tayana 37 sailboat. We've been living aboard since September 2013 all while doing MAJOR work on the boat and working full-time. Our goal is not to create the perfect boat (which doesn't exist), but to fix and upgrade our boat to suit us and what we want to do...which is travel! We're real hands-on type of people and Rich is seriously talented when it comes to fixing and making nearly anything, so most of our videos are about projects on which we're working. Future videos will be about sailing and travel, but for now, if you're looking for information on how to rewire your old boat, build a bowsprit, or even how to retrieve that halyard you lost up the mast, chances are we've done it!

NOTE - I do not intend on boring anybody viewing by showing most of the repetitive stuff!
Heavy editing will be in place!
So perhaps this channel could be helpful for anybody who may be wanting to see some more details in the building process and what/how much work is involved.

There is a lot of welding, grinding, plasma cutting and painting to do and in some ways this is an abject lesson in why it is easier to just buy a boat. But for those who like to tinker and do things themselves (and are masochistic) then building is an affliction that can not be avoided.

I am also putting a few videos on here about my other interests - flying, bikes (Harley VRod) and Model T Fords as I am currently trying to build a Model T Ford Speedster.

I struggle to complete videos as I do not have a lot of time and of course I am sub-1000 subscribers so make no money and am struggling to get much more than a few hundred views. Still I will try to create semi-interesting stuff and offer an unvarnished account of experiences.

Cruising the world and life onboard, is pretty difficult to describe to people verbally. Making videos about this lifestyle help them understand why we love it. This was the beginning of our sailing channel. The early footage was never intended to entertain, or enlighten, so the early vids are a bit of a patchwork. 

 I hope that our videos inspire other dreamers to reach out, focus and obtain your dreams.

Hopefully some inspiration to ""Quit Job and Go Sailing"". 

Life is not supposed to be about just getting by. I find it ridiculous to spend your life paying off a mortgage just so that at the end of it, you have somewhere to live. You‚Äôve only got one shot at it, as far as I can tell‚Ä¶. so make it special. ‚Ä®Dream big. Live in the ‚Äúnow‚Äù. Make every moment count‚Ä¶. towards your dreams.

We recently retired, chucked it all and moved aboard our 44-ft Mason sailboat, Juliet, along with our little dog Bubba. In October, 2019 we set sail to cruise around the Pacific Ocean for five years. Yes, you read that right...FIVE YEARS! Or maybe even longer. After decades of talking about this crazy idea, we're actually doing it.

This is not an easy lifestyle, but we are ready to face the hardships in order to experience a completely different way of life, and see places we normally would never get to see. We hope to inspire people to follow their dreams, wherever they may take them, however challenging they are.

The Coronavirus pandemic has added a whole new level of challenge to our adventure, but we're doing our best to pursue our adventure safely, and learn to live in this ""new normal"".

We thought it might be fun to document our travels for anyone thinking of following a similar lifestyle. So far we have visited 7 different countries and sailed over 13,000 nautical miles.

Most of the time sailing single handed and occasionally with friends and other guests. Dreaming of crossing the Pacific singlehanded.

Most of my life has been in the small coastal town T√∏nsberg, 95 km south of Oslo. With the national park at our doorsteps, and the Oslo fjord and Skagerak sea outside the windows, it was almost mandatory to own a boat.  I¬¥m almost raised in a sailboat and had my first by the age of 7. Not only did we spend 3 weeks every summer,  and every weekend of my childhood, on the lean (Sailing) But my parents owned a boat factory, where they manufactured sailboats and smaller motorboats. So I think its fair to say I've  been into sailing my whole life. 

MY LAST JOB
Full time working for the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue, and almost 10 years as voluntary and skipper for the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue.

In April of 2020, due to world events, I began to ponder the idea of chasing a long lost dream of learning to sail.  I began to think that it was time to stop pondering this dream, and make it happen!  Other than a few days of sailing a small Sunfish sailboat as teenager, I had no experience sailing.  However, those days on the lake in a small sailboat as a kid, I remembered thinking of how awesome it would be to cast the lines with a sailing vessel of my own.  With this renewed dream, I searched for the perfect boat to learn on and found her in an old 1982 Cape Dory 22'.  She was perfect in my eyes, but needed a good amount of work.  I decided to jump in and learn everything I could along the way.  From teak restoration, to electrical, painting, fiberglass, and bottom work, I meticulously learned every inch of her.  With the refit successful, I'm now learning how to captain her!  Join me!

Starting at buying our first sailboat, repairs, sailing,  and finally buying our liveaboard/cruising the world dream.  All on a very small budget! 

We were once told that we seem to be in our element when we are swimming against the current in a river of rice.
With our children leaving the nest soon, we have a goal to become live-aboard world cruisers. 

It starts with a sailboat.  Learning to sail, working on the vessel, upgrading it to play around with the engineering of making the boat self-sustainable...and of course, family trips and plenty of sailing!  We will be out learning the ropes, so to speak.  In a few years, we will be selling SV Yemoja and upgrading to a larger sized boat:  refitting for sustainable/cruiser/live-aboard/blue water capabilities, and sail the world.

So why watch us?  

Well, we aren't your average cruisers.  We're not another sailing channel cruising with the pack.  We think that we have something pretty unique to share. 

'Sailing' new cruising grounds. 'Traveling' the sea less traveled.  'Exploring' different Cultures. 

We hope that our stories will encourage others to get of the well trodden cruising paths, away from the crowds and go  Sail - Travel - Explore.
